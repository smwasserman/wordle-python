# wordle-python
A version of Wordle that runs in the terminal.
I made this my freshman year of college so I many have made some strange choices in the codebase which I wouldn't have made today.

The dictionary file was provided by the Colorado School of Mines CS department, and I'm not sure where they got it from.
As a warning, the dictionary does contain some curse words so watch out!

The first commit will contain the code as it was written, (by myself), two years ago.
I may make future changes to improve gameplay and performance.



## Instructions to Run
1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system,

2. Make sure that your terminal supports ANSI escape codes,
otherwise the colors will not display correctly.
**The default macOS terminal will not display colors properly.**
If you're running macOS, I would recommend using the terminal built into your code editor,
or use something like [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/) or [Ghostty](https://ghostty.org/).

3. Make sure `wordle_main.py` and `dictionary.txt` are in the same directory. Then run the following command:
``` bash
python3 wordle_main.py
```
