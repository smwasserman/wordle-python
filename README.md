# wordle-python
A version of Wordle that runs in the terminal.
I made this my freshman year of college so I many have made some strange choices in the codebase which I wouldn't have made today.

The dictionary file was provided by the Colorado School of Mines CS department, and I'm not sure where they got it from.
As a warning, the dictionary does contain some curse words so watch out!

The first commit will contain the code as it was written, (by myself), two years ago.
I may make future changes to improve gameplay and performance.
